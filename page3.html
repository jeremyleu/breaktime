<h1>EXAMPLE 2</h1>

<a href="http://www.newsmax.com">NewsMax.com</a> is a website that advertises its credibility and lack of bias. According to its logo (shown on left), the site is "independent" and "American," <img src="newsmaxlogo.png" style = "float:left;width:305px;height:121px;">making an effort to appear credible to its readers. For the most part, it successfully gives its readers the impression of a news site and is laid out as such; however, there are warning signs that point to its partial nature. Its appearance is very genre-conscious: the site includes many elements of credible news sources such as the date of the most recent update and the name of the author of the article.
<br><br>In its article "<a href = "http://www.newsmax.com/Viguerie/Chick-fil-A-gay-marriage-Obama/2012/07/30/id/447006">Chick-fil-A: Democrats&#39; War Against Christians</a>," the site attempts to reinforce the credibility of the author of the article with the following short biography about the author: "Richard A. Viguerie pioneered the use of direct mail in politics. He made it possible for candidates and causes to raise money from millions of small contributors rather than from a few 'fat cats.'" The lack of objective measures of the author's credibility, however, is an example of the possible inconsistencies of the "facts" provided by this website.

<br><br>
The most important of these warning signs is the content itself: not even its "article's" title, "Chick-fil-A: Democrats' War Against Christians," is exempt from signs of bias. The title is very extreme in stating that all Democrats are belligerents of such a "war against Christians," using Chick-Fil-A's recent controversy as an example of a "battle" in this claimed "war." Additionally, the article paints a picture of the Democratic Party as composed of bullies threatening democracy and religion through assertions such as "Far from being champions of the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and religion, and the &#39;tolerance&#39; prized by liberals, the Democratic Party has now, once and for all, dropped all pretense of respecting the values held by tens of millions of American Christians and has instead launched a concerted attack to undermine those values in favor of the radical homosexual agenda." The use of very extreme and emotionally attached language such as "the Democratic Party has... dropped all pretense of respecting the values of... American Christians" greatly detracts from the objective credibility of the website. There is much more evidence of bias throughout the remainder of the article.
<br><br>
The motive of the article's bias is presumably political, and the creators of the website use the ease of publishing on the Internet to their advantage by writing statements that clearly lean toward the conservative end of the spectrum and disguising them as impartial and objective.
