<h1>How to Identify a Credible Website</h1>

<i>Last updated December 2, 2012</i>

A study published by the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab suggests that the way in which Internet users evaluate the credibility of websites is fundamentally flawed. Consumers generally responded much more positively to the aesthetic appearance of a website than experts on the website topic did. The experts on the website topic placed more value on the reputation and information sources of the site and its affiliates.<br><br>
The study is useful in that it helps consumers be aware of their tendencies to correct them in the future. 
<br><br>When evaluating the credibility of a website, a reader of a website should look primarily for:<br>
 - The reputation of the publisher of the website and the website's affiliates<br>
 - The sources of the website that the website sources (it is very important that the website does cite sources)<br>
 - An author responsible for the reliability of the material of the website<br>
 - A publisher responsible for the reliability of the material of the website<br>
 - A publishing date to evaluate the currency of the website<br><br>
 On the other hand, a reader should be wary of websites with:<br>
 - Large obtrusive advertisements, questionable advertisements, or excessive advertisements<br>
 - Very obvious bias and motive for bias (for instance, discussion of politically sensitive material)<br>
 - Ads that are difficult to distinguish from content<br>
 - Typographical or grammar errors<br>
 - Broken links <br><br>
 Additionally, a clean layout that obviously presents information is important in the design of a website. Such a layout does not have to be especially elaborate, but a layout that hinders readability or distracts from content hurts the credibility of a website.
